#Summary
Author of the summary: currently not known. If found add note here to underlay good work made by him.
## 1
Study on periods of half an hour and then go away and do whatever ejoyable think you want in 5 minutes. Return to your desk and repeat.

## 2
Have a desk especially for studying. Have a room especially for studying and working. Have a lamp, chair anything especially for studying. Don't do other things in that enviroment. Go to other room or chari whenever you finish studying. 

## 3
Don't listen music esepecially designed for studying while you are studying. Be focused in only one thing at a time.

## 4
Difference between concepts and facts. Facts can be forgotten. It is natural. But the things you really wanna learn and keep in your mind are the concepts. How does it works? What is the function of it? how does it connect to other concepts? That is where you wanna struggle with.

## 5
Learning something is about to put a concept in your own words. To be able to explain that concept to  a friend, partner of studying, whoever asks you for an explanation

## 6
Take Notes, Your BRain is not a Hard Drive

## 7
Realize difference between recognition and recollection. Our brains are extremely good in "remembering" things (only recognizing), when we read passage after we virtually forgot it. The prove that you didin't remember that  is that you woudn't have  idea of that wthout the help that brought that old idea into your memory

## 8
Sleep good. That the main way the brain consolidates long term memory into permanent memory.

## 9 
About notes. Right after class take 5-10 minutes to read and expand notes. Make them more deep and explain things with your own words. If you don't have anyone to explain or talk about it write it down. That is a very important factor on getting useless notes into usable notes.

## 10
Teach another person. If you are teaching and you don't remember something or you can't get into good explanation, them you know where are the gaps of information that you have and what you have to study again or ask teacher next day. If you can't or do not anyone next to you, teach an empty chair. That is nothing wrong (really ?!) with talking to yourself, nobody or imaginary friend. Or, again write it down. Make a dialouge with imgainry friend, explain him everything (try to predict possible questions). 
### 10.1 
In this place i've recall (more or less) statement talked by Richard Feynman that if you want to really understand something you have to be able to exaplain anything (event complex thing) to the child (i don't remember if he gave an example age of a child). Thanks for this you are mangling information, catching concept, this is your journey from low details to high level big picture.

## 11
Textbooks. Use the SQR3 method: Survey, Question, Read, Recite and Review. 
Firt, you wanna know that text boook is not a novel, 
 - so the text book can be reviewd  (strucuture, images, qoutes). 
 - Sometimes books have a list of questions at the end of the chapter (I'm not sure that in PL this is often practice).  They are tips from the author what are the most important facts and concepts of the given book part. If we write them down(or remember the main question) before main studing phase, they can lead us to more efficiently learning (we know in fact what we should find)
 - read the bold word, title ,sub titles
 - read the first and last paragraph in the book. If the book is well written the first sentence will be introduction to the subject and the last one will be the review of the what was all about.
 - read the whole thing
 - try to answer the qeustion that you find out before
 - re-read again, catch main ideas, take the notes 
 - finish answering for the rest qeustions
 - try exaplain all to your 6 eyar old child, write an essay about subject, and in doubts part back to paper book and find the answer
When you have study done, there are 3 material to study with:
 - text books with usefull marks,
 - list of answered questions
 - an essay, mind map etc, exaplaining all of it and made completely by you from zero to one hundred

## 12
Recall. Between each steps (in point 11) make 30 second break and try to remember everything you have learn;t before only in your mind. Try to do as close as it is possible with the learining material.

## 13
Use mnemonics to remember things: acronyms, associations with images, a coined phrase, anything else.
