# PREFACE
## Story Flow
- Treat it as a closing letter (on the begening)
- inured but not indifferent
  - as respond for author and his efforts misinterpretation in public prints
- bored
  - stil the same reviews, the same slogans joined with his the most known and controversial works (Mother Teresa, Diana, Bill Clinton)
  - such repeated and not original review can marginalised  or even kill dissenting
- examples part
  - visit in Vatican connected with Mother Teresa cannonisation
    - they asked him about what he knew about her, his findings
    - so his public disagree had impact on something (bore doubts about reason to cannanisation)
    - they recorded everything. Record is not a monopoly of the fundamentalists
  - Diana exhaustive documentary
    - author as one of guest
  - Milosevic
    - beutiful quote "I was quitly proud of what little I've done and ashamed by how little that was"
    - interesting fact about Milosevic deportation from Serbia in exchange of promise for financial Aid
  - Clinton, Kissinger
  - Orwell as much more pleasure subject than above

All that examples had been done not only for boasting, but also for making harder the life of "false people" and showing their real faces to public audience. Sometimes disident work vindicate to be had, which even more mark this work as meaningfull. At the he thank for provoking him to writing. All others units were created to reinfornce what was mentioned about truth and loud expressing them.

## Summary

## Additional extened explanation 
- soixant-haitard - from french means 68'ers. It is directly connected with situation in France in 1968 year. There were massive demonstration started  at the university but in the end a lot people participate in it. All of this was against overcrowded student residence, authoritarian cabinet, war in Vietnam, low wage. De Gaulle and Pompidue annouse cabinet dissolution which stopped the manifestation. But what was a littele bit suprsing degaullian party after elections had even the greater power than before (worth to repeat that authoritarian cabinet was one of the manifestiotion reason). From historicion point of view this year was a year of France awaknes in terms of cultural values of love, peace and tolerance. This was the begening of changes in french society.
- strikes were an occasion for hard leftist,marksist, trotskist to show thier presense for public opinion. There were a lot of Mao posters - but I'm not sure if Mao was representant of good or bad example for future of France
