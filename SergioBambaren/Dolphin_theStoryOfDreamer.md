# SUMMARY
When You forget who you really are, about what you dreamt of, how to dream: this book is probaly good starting point. Straightoforward story, commonnly known quotes, at the first look seems to be trival with a scheme like in  holywood films:
 - main character different than group around him
 - has different opinions about life and its aim
 - run in the journey through world, full of beauty and cruelty
 - met a lot of interesting creatures, which gave him a lot of advices and support him during his journey
 - finally found his target, ideal surfing wave
 - by the way met people (different anime) who have the same soul like his
 - back to the birth place, and tell other his story. 
 - Convince a lot of them that they should hunt for living not live for hunting

Book contains a lot commonly known advices, but if not said loudly forgetten. So it is worth read and bring them to mind once again:
 - be yourself
 - try to fullfill your dreams
 - others probably won't help you or even support, they with great probability will try convincu you to their point of view
 - fullfilling dream is no an easy and short road
 - dream every day
 - dream to know who you are, what do you want to do, dream about what you want to achieve
 - not everything can be planned or be known sometimes you have rely on your feelings
 - acheivings goals is danger
 - old schemas can be not relevant for todays world, or not properly understood
 - you cannot teach people how to live, you can show them how you live and be example for them
 - sometimes there is no other choice than going your own path
 - consumptionism can make our lives not true life, not our life

Straithtforward, Trivial? Yes. But i think that was a plan. Sometimes all can be served clearly, without place for guessing and analysing and it not bad. Key messeage is sent properly and if don't want to forget about dreaming read carefully from time to time and remember who you are. If don't know who you read in firt place, and maybe it will be easier to find out how to look your real self.
