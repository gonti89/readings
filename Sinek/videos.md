Infinity Game as way of succues in bussines.
Trust as real managing tool.
You can see world in two ways: what do You want? what is a struggle that prevent You before what you want?
Millenials as people with problems because:
- they were learned that they are special, they can have and acheieve all what they want, instantly
Today's problems: Lack trust, Lack of patience, instantiness, no deep relations. 
To much social media and phones is problem because it makes us unable to build real relations, or even to try real relations.


#Summary
Generalky i have a problem with speakers like Simon Sinek. Generally all what is he talking is truth or make sense. All things about leadership, trust, self happines. But there are some doubts: are they really so many jobs that can take workers final gratification in the form of passion? Why us he not underlaying corporate responsibility from human enviroment as all, I think that this overmentioning such things can be interpretet in way that we need less focus on money, more on our workes, be honest and make interest in people, but what with reposonsibility on the whole our deliveris, if they had proper money for their work, if the workers have proper salary, if the enviroment in place when our subproducts are imported isn't finally destructed. 
Maybe not all things at once, and it better to start changing the world in one place, not in all at once, but how to not forget about all other things in the future. Or this not a good thing. If don't take into consideration all metrics how you can properly plan form your vision. Vision is te key world and the vision shouldn't be too detailed but have to be complete and coherent as a whole.
Now, I belevie that grat things can happend if the people around us belive in what we believe in also.

Some people works for money, they need pay checks i buy food for their families is it bad that their work is not their passion? Maybe they even don't have a time to find out what they really are.
